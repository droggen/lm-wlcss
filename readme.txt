Reference [1] details the overall dataset, the scenario, the multimodality and sensor networking aspects of the setup, quality metrics, and best practices for the recording of complex multimodal activity datasets. Reference [2] provides the performance of a baseline activity recognition system on the OPPORTUNITY dataset, which can be used as a benchmark performance.
